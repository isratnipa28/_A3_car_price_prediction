## A3 - Car Price Prediction: Web-Based Application with Machine Learning and CI/CD Integration

This project is a web-based application that predicts car prices using a machine learning model built with Dash by Plotly. The app features a clean and interactive user interface. If any form fields are left empty, the system intelligently handles missing values by auto-filling them before making predictions

## Project Structure
_A3_car_price_prediction/ – Contains Jupyter notebooks and all relevant project files.

main.py – Entry point and main application script.

model/ – Stores the machine learning model used for prediction.

test_pred.py – Script used for automated testing during the CI/CD process.

test/ – Contains additional test files for CI/CD.

.Dockerfile – Defines the required dependencies and setup for containerization.

docker-compose.yaml – Configuration file to run the app in a Docker container.

Screenshots/ – Includes images of the MLflow environment, model artifacts, and app UI hosted on the ML server.

README.md – Project overview and documentation.
